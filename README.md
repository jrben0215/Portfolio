**The Power BI file will require Microsoft Power BI Desktop in order to run.**

These projects are examples of me using code to extract information from data. With the Walmart data I discovered relationships between gender, age, and purhcase rate which could lead to targeted marketing. The Large Language Model code was from a class I took called "Statistical Learning" where we went through the foundations of coding in Python for supervised and machine learning techniques. Lastly, the file regarding walmart e-commerce is using the Walmart Sales Data and plugging it into Power BI's interface to get a nice visual of what this data actually looks like, making it easier to drive business decisions.
